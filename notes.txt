Smart Semantic Mapping

Then starting the rules creation process a snapshot of the rows that have been inserted shall be 
taken, and only after the end should be removed.
A secondary AtomicCacheGeneric shall be tracking which rows have been updated, deleted or inserted 
and those shall be appended to the main AtomicCacheGeneric at the end of the rules creation process.

Schema 

[Main AtomicCacheGeneric]  [Secondary AtomicCacheGeneric]  [AtomicBool Append_To_Secondary]

~ No rules creation process running ~

[ true ]                     [ false ]                       [ false ]

~ Rules creation process started ~

[ true ]                    [ true ]                        [ true ]

-> Take Snapshot (1)

~ Rules creation process ended ~

[ true ]                    [ false ]                       [ false ]
                               
                         -> Take Snapshot (2)

Compare Snapshot 1 and Snapshot 2.
Clear Main AtomicCacheGeneric.
Append updated, deleted, and inserted rows to Main AtomicCacheGeneric derived from the comparison.
Clear Secondary AtomicCacheGeneric.
